# This is conjunction of https://github.com/bluvoll/sd-scripts and https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_scripts_Backend . GitHub doesn't allow me to fork one repository multiple times, so I did this. :pepega: (NoobAI XL discord server emoji. It is actually a fun place, do visit.)

Whether this is a piece of slop or a utility, only tests will tell.

The intention is to use it to train lora in https://huggingface.co/CabalResearch/NoobAI-Flux2VAE-RectifiedFlow/resolve/main/NoobAI%20Flux2VAE%20RF%20v0.1.safetensors without using any GUI.

Now go and test this if you are interested. Otherwise at least test the model for youself before judging.
